In order for this to work, you need to download the airport database. Download
[this file](https://datahub.io/core/airport-codes/r/airport-codes.json) from
[datahub.io](https://datahub.io/core/airport-codes#data), and store it with the
name `airports.json` root of the `aviation_database` crate (where the
`build.rs` resides).
