Feature: Mode 1: Excessive Rate of Descent
  The Mode 1 alert is intended to generate caution alerts and time-critical
  warning alerts when the aircraft has a high rate of descent relative to its
  height above terrain. Mode 1 is active during all segments of flight. In
  order to reduce nuisance alerts during steep approaches, an optional set of
  alerting curves may be employed when the aircraft is performing a steep
  approach. The determination if a steep approach is in progress can either be
  based on an input to the Equipment (such as a pilot-activated steep approach
  switch) or it can be based on internal logic (such as comparison of aircraft
  position to approach profiles in a database).

  @MOPS_268
  Scenario: Mode Arming/Disarming
    Given the plane is flying
    Then Mode 1 shall be armed

    #Rule: Standard Caution Envelope (MOPS_269, MOPS_270)

    @MOPS_269
    Scenario Outline: Must Alert
      Given Mode 1 is armed
      And Mode 1 is not inhibited
      And steep approach is not selected
      When the rate of descent is at least <rate of descent> feet per minute
      And the height above terrain is between 100 and <height> feet
      Then a Mode 1 caution alert is emitted within 2 seconds

      Examples:
        | rate of descent | height |
        | 1560            | 100    |
        | 2200            | 630    |
        | 5700            | 2200   |

    @MOPS_270
    Scenario: Must Not Alert when not Armed
      Given Mode 1 is not armed
      Then a Mode 1 caution alert is not emitted at all

    @MOPS_270
    Scenario: Must Not Alert when Inhibited
      Given Mode 1 is inhibited
      Then a Mode 1 caution alert is not emitted at all

    @MOPS_270
    Scenario Outline: Must Not Alert
      Given steep approach is not selected
      When the rate of descent is at most <rate of descent> feet per minute
      But the height above terrain is not between 10 and <height> feet
      Then a Mode 1 caution alert is not emitted at all

      Examples:
        | rate of descent | height |
        | 964             | 10     |
